A predator-prey simulation representing an underwater environment.
It involves sharks, otters, shrimp, plankton and humans.

This is the first version of the simulation. This version
does not use inheritance.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
